Jams, grappas, craft beer, cured meats, cheeses, wines, honey, the breadsticks of the Donadelli bakery in Chiusaforte; we have selected for you excellent products from the Friuli area, some made with km0 raw materials. If you liked them you can buy them and bring them to your home to continue to relive the flavors of the mountain."
