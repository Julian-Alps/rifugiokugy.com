  title: "Sleeping in the refuge"
  text: "Linger before bed and roll your eyes, admire all the stars invisible from the city, fall asleep in the calming silence of a small mountain town, wake up and remember that waiting for you out there are the beauty of the meadows blooming in summer and the whiteness of the snowy peaks during the winter. These are just some of the reasons that make the Kugy refuge a special place to stay. Characteristic of our rooms is simplicity. The absence of televisions and background music is our conscious choice that will allow you to rediscover the pleasure of silence and the warmth of being in company."

# Welcome to Refuge Kugy Casa Alpina Valbruna!
## Be surprised by the magical Julian Alps
<br>
<blockquote style="color: gray">
<p>“When they appeared to me on the heights of the Karst, in the luminous glare of the sea, flooded with light and sun, in their calm solemnity, so distant and unreachable, my soul held them in an embrace, with all the violence of her dreams. [...] No matter how many mountains I have seen, nothing equals the Giulie. The dreams of youth created the homeland of my soul.”</p><cite>Dalla vita di un alpinista - Julius Kugy</cite>
</blockquote>

We want to borrow words and emotions from the "Cantore delle Giulie" and make them our own; we come from his own seaside town and who in this part of the Alps have decided to stop.
Born in Gorizia and adopted in Trieste, Julius Kugy devoted most of his mountaineering career to these mountains and among the most important ascents we find the peaks that surround the refuge dedicated to him.

The Casa Alpina Kugy refuge was obtained from the renovation of the old building that housed the mill in the village of Valbruna. Located at the entrance of the Val Saisera and at two steps from the Alpe Adria Radweg cycle path (FVG1), it wants to be the ideal starting and arrival point for those who love to explore the Julian Alps during all seasons.
