Any suggestions:

- **Monte Lussari**: an evergreen of the Julian Alps, from whose top enjoy a panorama of the surrounding peaks. For those wishing the gondola lift is also active in summer, otherwise you can reach the Sanctuary on the top by the convenient forest road or the Pilgrim's path.

- **Path of the resonance trees / The Forest Sound Track**: 5.5 km route that plunges into the extraordinary spruce forest for the production of musical instruments such as violins, violas, cellos, guitars, pianos, harpsichords, all over the world . Starting from Valbruna you can also reach other points of interest: a site of malformed spruce trees due to pathogenic nodes in the subsoil, a small art park called Altrememorie, the Sabuata source and, in the final part, when you have already reached the wood of the trees of Resonance, you will cross the Abschnitt Saisera, a theme park of the Great War.

In this suggestive context, in June, the Risonanze festival is held: music in the woods. This year, given the circumstances, it was canceled and postponed to 2021. In the meantime, however, the digitalization of the path is planned and, thanks to an app, it will be possible to consult multimedia content and an accompanying audio guide to discover the forest and harmonic wood.

- **Thematic path of the Great War (Abschnitt Saisera)**: we went through it personally and we highly recommend it, not only for its historical value but because there really is to be amazed.

- **Malga Rauna** and **Cappella Zita**: starting from Valbruna you can devote yourself to this easy excursion, to be done even in winter with snowshoes. Take the path Cai 607 and passing through Malga Rauna you can enjoy beautiful views of the Cima del Cacciatore. Sunsets are wonderful on sunny days. At 1515 m you can visit the Zita Chapel that survived the war events of the Great War.

- **Monte Nebria**: With an easy circular route, you start from Valbruna and follow the Cai 608 and 658 paths. It is a walk that we recommend to everyone because, albeit with a moderate elevation, it guarantees a 360 ° panorama. The peaks are two, east and west, and the path follows a military track.

- **Grego refuge**: starting from Val Saisera and following the Cai 611 path that crosses a beautiful beech forest, you can go up to the Grego refuge. A magnificent view will reveal the Jôf Montasio in its grandeur: Crests of Dragons, North Tower, Amalia, many of the routes that Kugy traveled and that he immortalized in his writings.

- **Jôf di Somdogna** and **Jôf of Miezegnot**: starting right from the Grego Refuge and still covering 400 m of altitude difference, you reach the Somdogna peak. From the saddle of the same name, however, you can take the path Cai 609 and, meeting testimonies of the Great War, reach the top of Miezegnot.

- **Pellarini Refuge** and **Monte Nabois**: the refuge is part of the beautiful setting of the Jôf Fuart group and can be reached with the Cai 616 path, first on a forest track and then on a path. Once you arrive, you must go up to the Grande Nabois.

### For Pilgrims

- **Celestial Way** or **Iter Aquileiense**: Are you lost? Follow the fish that symbolizes this 200 km long pilgrimage. The fascinating path that cuts through the entire region is defined as a small spine of Friuli Venezia Giulia. In ten stages, it winds from the city of Aquileia and reaches its last stop right here in the town of Valbruna, and up to the top of Monte Lussari. It is entirely passable from June to September while in winter some sections are covered by snow.

### Bike

For those who like to jump on their bikes and travel on two wheels we offer the following routes:

- **Val Bartolo**, **Sella di Bartolo**, **Malga Acomizza**: starting from Camporosso you can follow this beautiful track that winds beyond the Italian-Austrian border.

- **Puanina Bike**: the 35 km circuit starts directly from the Kugy refuge. With a vertical drop of 700 meters, it is a path of medium difficulty. The first stretch on the road leads to the comfortable cycle path. Reached the inhabited area of ​​Ugovizza, we proceed on an asphalted and partly unpaved road towards the Nordio refuge (mt. 1420). We then descend to Malga Priu in Val Rauna (1255 m) and from there to the Gortani Refuge (1100 m). Return to Valbruna from the Sella di Vuom in Camporosso.
The whole area offers landscapes surrounded by green meadows and various refuges and farmhouses can be reached.


- **Valbruna - Sella Prasnig - Riofreddo - Ortigara - Ciclabile - Tarvisio - Valbruna**: with a length of 46 km and a maximum difference in height of 650 meters, the route winds along a cycle path and forest roads. It starts from Valbruna, travels a stretch of the Val Saisera and reaches the Prasnig saddle (1491 m). A penden descent follows.
